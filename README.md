# knight-travails-js

Simple side project done for The Odin Project.
Place a Knight on a chessboard square (like A1) and give it a destination (like H8).
The returned path is always the shortest, it will return both the length of the path and the path itself.

## Things I learned

- Solidified graph knowledge and shortest path algorithms
- Usage of shortest path algorithms, in this case A\*
- When to use what data structure
